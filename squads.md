# Squads

Each student will be assigned a squad. Each squad is led by an instructor and will be made up of 6-7 students. Squad meetings are an opportunity to get to know some of your fellow students better. Your squad instructor will be responsible for grading your homework assignments and projects. Feel free to reach out to them if you have any questions about the course.
