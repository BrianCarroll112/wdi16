# One-on-Ones

Two instructors will be available every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday between 1:30PM - 2:30PM for 15-minute meetings by appointment. Students are required to schedule a one-on-one with an instructor of their choice at least once a month.

Students may only sign up for one 1:1 meeting at a time. After that meeting takes place, you are welcome to sign up for another one.

They're a safe space to talk about literally anything. One-on-Ones might include:
- Code review
- Discussing concepts covered in class
- Talking about your career search
- Thinking through project ideas
- Emotional issues
- Generally shooting the breeze

**It's up to you** what gets covered during the one-on-ones, so please come with questions prepared!
